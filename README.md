# Interactive Calculator



The Interactive Calculator is a web-based application built using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. It provides users with a simple yet powerful tool for performing basic mathematical calculations in a visually appealing and user-friendly manner.

### Key Features:

1. User-Friendly Interface:
The calculator interface is designed using HTML5 and CSS3, providing an intuitive and visually appealing layout. The buttons and input fields are styled to enhance the user experience and make the calculator easy to navigate.

2. Basic Mathematical Operations:
The calculator supports essential mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Users can input numerical values and perform calculations by clicking the appropriate buttons.

3. All Clear and Delete Functions:
The calculator includes a "All Clear" button to reset the input field, allowing users to start a new calculation. Additionally, there is a "Delete" function that allows users to delete one by one digit during calculations.

4. Mouse Support:
The calculator is responsive for only mouse inputs. Users can enter numbers and perform operations using their keyboard, making it accessible and convenient for all users.

5. Error Handling:
The calculator incorporates error handling to prevent invalid inputs and calculations. It displays error messages when users attempt to divide by zero or enter non-numeric characters.

### Technical Implementation:

The calculator project will be implemented using the following technologies:

1. HTML5:
HTML5 provides the structure and layout for the calculator interface. It defines the different sections, input fields, and buttons required for the calculator.

2. CSS3:
CSS3 is used to style the calculator interface, making it visually appealing and responsive. It defines the color schemes, button styles, and overall layout of the calculator.

3. JavaScript:
JavaScript is the core programming language for implementing the calculator's functionality. It handles user inputs, performs calculations, and updates the display accordingly. JavaScript event listeners are used to capture button clicks and keyboard inputs, triggering the appropriate actions.

### Conclusion:

The Interactive Calculator project utilizes HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript to create a user-friendly and functional calculator application. It provides a visually appealing interface with support for basic mathematical operations, memory functions, and error handling. The calculator is responsive to both mouse and keyboard inputs, making it accessible to a wide range of users.
